# Course overview & procedure



This course aims to explore the relation between Intelligence and possible biological factors, such as brain size etc.
This will be done in three course blocks that will necessarily build on each other.

`1.Block: Introduction`

In our introductory sessions II & III we will start off by discussing how intelligence is defined and measured, as well as which models of intelligence are commonly discussed. Following we will talk about different brain-imaging methods, that will provide the base for the neuroscientific exploration of intelligence and its correlates.

`2.Block: The intelligent brain`

In the second block we will be exploring the structural and functional neural correlates of intelligence, as well as related topics such as genetic components & neurocognitive models of intelligence.

The second block will be separated into 4 sessions, each session will start off with a general introduction to the topic and a short presentation that provides students with a working hypothesis or research question, that will followingly be discussed or otherwise be actively explored. The specifics of each session are dependent on the ideas of the presenting group, with assistance from the course instructors.

`3.Block: Topics of interest`

While the first and second blocks established the foundations for our understanding of the neuroscientific view on intelligence, 
the third and last block will be dedicated to delving deeper into topics of interest. We will also be discussing the implications of biological research on intelligence for education and public policy.
Students are welcome to provide ideas/recommendations on topics that they may want to explore.

### TL;DR

Within this course we will explore the concept of human intelligence from a neuroscientific perspective, specifically how intelligence can be conceptualized using neurocognitive models and brain-imaging methods. To do so, we will follow a 3 Block design (Intoduction/Basics/specific topics). Each course session will be prepared by a group of presenting studenst with the assistance of the instructors.

### Gimme the details

Below you will find important details regarding the course summarized in a compact form. Please consult and familiarize yourself with the information presented there prior to and/or within the first few days of the course. 


#### What about the pandemic? 

Until further notice, it is assumed that the course will take place in person. This may be subject to change, but given everything we experienced and learned in the last years this seems unlikely. Should changes to the course format be mandated, you'll be notified ASAP.
If you feel uncomfortable doing a busy commute to sit in a room with several other people, please let me know and I'll give my best to come up with a hybrid format. However, based on current regulations there won't be any recordings. Just in case: yes, everyone should wear a mask at all times (although this is not to be understood as an official regulation, as that would not be permitted by the university)!

#### How do I get all the software/hardware and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

We won't be needing any software or hardware out of the norm (i.e. classic office applications). Students will be expected to either bring their own laptops or send their materials via e-mail to the instructors the night before their respective session.


#### Where is everything?

All course materials (lecture slides, additional resources, assignments, etc.) will be available on the [course website](link-to-index.html), i.e. the one you're looking at right now. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are **free to explore, enhance and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up for the entire duration of the course and beyond, ideally to the end of the internet. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.


#### Syllabus and Text

This page serves as the syllabus for this course. This syllabus is subject to change; students who miss class are responsible for learning about any changes to the syllabus.

We will mainly be relying on two prominent textbooks for this course:

`Barbey, A. K., Karama, S., & Haier, R. J. (Eds.). (2021). The Cambridge handbook of intelligence and cognitive neuroscience. Cambridge University Press.`

`Haier, R. J. (2017). The neuroscience of intelligence. Cambridge University Press.`

Both books should be accessible via the online catalog of the Goethe-University [OPAC](https://lbsopac.rz.uni-frankfurt.de/DB=30/). Should this eventually change or you encounter any problems regarding access to course literature contact the instructors ASAP.

Additional reading material for specific sessions might be added but will always be open & free with students being informed about any addition.



#### How to get those credits?

Zum Bestehen des Seminars muss jeder Studierende die folgenden Leistungen ablegen.

Studienleistung:
Aktive, regelmäßige Teilnahme, Impulsreferat + Kurzzusammenfassung/Steckbrief (in Kleingruppen); Sprache Englisch/Deutsch

- Vorbesprechung der Präsentation 1 Woche vor Termin (Muss keine fertige Präsentation sein, sondern Vorschläge + Ideen und Struktur vorbereitet + Literaturliste)
- Hochladen Kurzzusammenfassung/Steckbriefs bis Freitag in der Woche vor Termin; d.h Mail an mich Freitag bis 18Uhr



##### Exams and Assignments

Students that would like to earn a grade in this seminar will have to register as per usual via the online services of the university.

The actual graded will work will consist of a written assignment (min. 10 -  max. 15 pages +/- 1). The actual topic of the assignment will be either up to you (i.e. approach the instructor with an idea, structure & relevant literature) or will be chosen from options provided by the instructors throughout the semester. You'll not be allowed to write a paper on the same topic that you've presented as part of your "Studienleistung". The deadline for the assignment will be updated here as soon as possible.

Formalities:
Times New Roman,
font size 12,
1.5 line spacing,
Citations & References in APA style

##### Late Assignment Policy

`Assignments` (Präsentation/Kurzzusammenfassung) will, in general, have a clearly stated due date, so as to manage course load clearly. Exceptions will be communicated. Please check the respective sections of this course and don't hesitate to ask questions if things are unclear. Generally `Assignments` must be turned in on the due date in order to earn participation credits for the course. Assignments have to be handed in via e-mail to the [instructor](Ernst@psych.uni-frankfurt.de).

Late `Assignments` will be accepted under _exceptional circumstances_ (e.g., medical or family emergency etc.) and at the discretion of the instructor (e.g. exceptional "denotes a rare event) with no penalty. This would likely result in changes in the expected course timeline and should therefore be clearly communicated as soon as possible to the instructors.

This policy allowing for exceptional circumstances is definitely a right, but courtesy to be used when needed and not to abused. Should you encounter such circumstances, simply email the assignment to the instructor and note "late submission due to exceptional circumstances". **You do not need to provide any further justification or personally revealing information regarding the details.**

##### Absenteeism Policy

Per university regulations attendance is mandatory, but you'll be allowed to miss 2 sessions. Should you be unable to attend beyond this please contact the [instructor](Ernst@psych.uni-frankfurt.de) ASAP, to discuss possible arrangements. In general, the same _exceptional circumstance_ policy as above will be followed.


##### Academic Honor Code

You are encouraged to discuss problem sets with classmates and work on them together, but certain written submissions must reflect your own, original work. If you worked with other students on a problem set, no worries, please include their names in a statement like "I worked on this homework with XX and YY" on the assignment. If in doubt, ask the instructor.
If text is verbatim or in thought copied from other works without alterations or accreditation, this will be understood as an attempt at deception and treated as such. The same goes for any kind of reproduction of any other published work, as per usual.


##### Notice about missed work due to religious holy days

We might miss some things, so please notify the instructors of your pending absence at least 7 days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after your absence.


### Student Accommodations

- Please request a meeting as soon as possible to discuss any accommodations.
- Please notify me as soon as possible if the material being presented in class is not accessible.
- Please notify me if any of the physical accommodations are difficult to use or access for you.


### Code of conduct

This course has a `Code of conduct`. Please inform yourself about the specifics by carefully reading through the [respective section](link-to-CoC.html).



### How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback

These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

If you have:

**- questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so either use the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin, `e-mail` or the resptive [GitHub repository](https://github.com/name_of_repo/issues) of this course.

**- a technical assignment question** - come to office hours (after making an appointment) or use the provided communication platform to reach out (e.g. discord, slack etc.). Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask (and include error messages when appropriate!).


**- been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start** - Research can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. **That’s OK - we’ve all been there!** IF you are stuck and don't know how to continue your work, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30-minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, e-mail). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, what you are trying to achieve etc.).


**- questions about course logistics** - first, check the [overview](link-to-overview.html) & [syllabus](link-to-outline.html). If you can’t find the answer there, first ask a classmate.

**- something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth** - feel free to contact the instructors or come to office hours. 

**- some feedback about the course you want to share anonymously** - If you’ve been offended by an example in class, really liked or disliked a lesson, or wish there were something covered in class that wasn’t but would rather not share this publicly, etc., please fill out the anonymous [Google Form](https://forms.gle/684MNEZSufQ4VAV49)*

*This form can be taken down at any time if it’s not being used for its intended purpose; however, you all will be notified should that happen.
