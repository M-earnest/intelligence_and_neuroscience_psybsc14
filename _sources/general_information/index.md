Welcome to the website for the course "Das intelligente Gehirn", (Module PsyBSc14 of the Goethe University Frankfurt; SOSE2023).

The following pages will be a collection of all the necessary information students need to successfully complete this course, as well as eventually the generated materials for each session.



## "Das intelligente Gehirn"

Within this course we will explore the concept of intelligence from a neuroscientific perspective.

You can use the following sections or the left sidebar to navigate through the contents of the website:

* [Overview & procedure ]()

   What's this course all about? How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline]()

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught? What's the timeplan?

* [Introduction]()

   All things gotta start somewhere, but how?

* [Content]()

   What is this course gonna contain?

* [Code of Conduct]()

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe, and inclusive learning experience.
   
* [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion]()

   What to look out for, what to keep in mind and how to treat each other.

## I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties with the lecture and its materials, please donâ€™t hesitate a single second to get in touch with us. A great way to do this is to open an issue on the GitHub site of the course. You can of course further contact us via [E-mail](Ernst@psych.uni-frankfurt.de).
